\paragraph{}

Chapters 8 and 12 of “Linux Kernel Development 3rd edition” (published June 2010), by Robert Love discussed what a bottom half is and does and how memory is allocated and managed in the kernel. In each of these readings, the author focuses on one main idea in each chapter, chapter 8 being softirqs and chapter 12 being pages. In order for the author to get the reader to understand the material, he goes into extreme detail and implementation of these data types so the reader can understand the big picture. The audience this section is most shaped towards are people who understand code, such-as in chapter 8 where he defines what a page is and how it is related to an interrupt and implements it using C, and does the same thing with softirqs in chapter 12.
