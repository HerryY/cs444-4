\paragraph{}

Chapters 1 and 2 of “Linux Kernel Development 3rd edition” (published June 2010), by Robert Love discussed the history of the Linux Kernel and setting up the kernel environment. The author uses the history of Unix to familiarize the reader with the kernel and then uses code examples and summaries to help the user build the kernel. The author uses this strategy to gain credibility in order for the reader to trust that the author knows what is going on. By using the history to gain credibility and using code examples to help with his arguments, he is implying that his audience knows how to code and cares about how something is made.
